# hello Django

This is my first Django project following [CS50's Week 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/3/) 

It's a simple website that consists of 3 sub-Apps:

1. myTasks: A simple to-do list that allows user to view and add tasks
2. newYear: It just an answer to one question (Is today a new year begginning?)
3. subApp

What I 've learned:

* django templating language
* managing sessions
* django forms
* routes and views
